## State Transition Matrix

$$
\mathbf{x}_i = \Phi(t_i, t_j)\mathbf{x}_j
$$
In the above expression

- $\Phi(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a state transition matrix,
- $\mathbf{x}_i$ is a state vector at time $t_i$,
- $\mathbf{x}_j$ is a state vector at time $t_j$,

and note that $t_i \leq t_j$ or $t_i \geq t_j$ can be true for a given instance.
