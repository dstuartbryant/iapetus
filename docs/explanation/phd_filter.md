Let $f_{\Xi}(X)$ denote the multitarget probability distribution of a random finite set $\Xi$, where $X$ denotes some finite set (to include the empty set $\emptyset$).

As detailed in [Mahler 2007 book], the probability hypothesis density (PHD) is analogous to the notion of expected value, illustrated as
$$
\begin{equation}
D_{\Xi}(\mathbf{x}) \triangleq \mathrm{E}\left[ \delta_{\Xi}(\mathbf{x})\right] = \int \delta_{X}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot f_{\Xi}(X)\delta X,
\end{equation}
$$
where $\mathbf{x}$ denotes a single-target state vector and $\delta_{X}(\mathbf{x})$.

LEFT OFF HERE. NEED TO DEFINE DIRAC MEASURE
