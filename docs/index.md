This site contains the project documentation for the
`iapetus` project.

Its aim is to provide a framework for researching, demonstrating, and sharing
single- and multi-object filtering (aka target tracking) approaches and
implementations. 

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
