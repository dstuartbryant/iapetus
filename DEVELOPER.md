## Onboarding

*Add helpful instructions here before getting to the point where we need to install Pandoc*.

### Install Pandoc
*Pandoc* is needed to render bibtex style's appropriately, i.e., it's a dependency for getting the `mkdocs-bibtex` fully functional.

- macOS: see - https://pandoc.org/installing.html

## Hints

### Link open in new tab
To ensure a link opens in a new tab of a user's browser, add `{:target="_blank"}` just after the markdown link. 

Example: 
```
[Google](https://www.google.com){:target="_blank"}
```
